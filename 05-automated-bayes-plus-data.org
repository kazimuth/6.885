* intro
  various businesses are trying this out.

  the problem is kinda invisible: easy to think "hey, people have R, statistics is fine"

  - domain expert
  - field researcher
  - statistician
  how do we: check our assumptions, bring in new data, ...
  -> some narrow solutions

  problem: using sparse data to learn interactions within a whole genome
  works okay, about as well as biologists expect
  can apply data-flow analysis + ... to programs, learn interactions and rules
  simple modeling (linear correlations w/ gaussian): totally fails
  fancy modeling (whole-program bayesian): works well

  bayesdb: basic stuff to causal/mechanistic modeling

  "we have to accept statistical incompetence as the norm"

  anything more complicated than a spreadsheet is going to be hard to convince people with

  data analysis is in practice, crazy
