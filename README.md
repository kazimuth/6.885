## Final project
For my final project I implemented inference of force fields from their effect
on particles, using a Gaussian Process prior for the value of the field. The code is implemented in the Julia language using the Gen framework for bayesian inference -- specifically, I use metropolis-hastings hierarchical monte carlo.

To view visualizations, open `final/final.jl` in [Juno](https://junolab.org/), and use alt-enter
to run the sections for different visualizations.

A writeup of the project is available at [`final-writeup/finalwriteup.pdf`](https://github.com/kazimuth/6.885/blob/master/final-writeup/finalwriteup.pdf).
